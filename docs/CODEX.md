## üß† Concept

"If You Could Go Back In Time" is a philosophical-simulation game.

- Players attempt to transmit useful knowledge into the past.
- They are scored on environmental correctness, cultural adoption likelihood, and potential historical impact.
- Players navigate branching "Rabbit Holes" if they can demonstrate sufficient coherence.

## üî• Key Game Mechanics

- **Environmental Coherence**: Objective truthfulness.
- **Cultural Coherence**: Subjective adoptability.
- **Impact Score**: Magnitude of influence if adopted.

- **Settings Toggle**: Can enable/disable cultural coherence consideration.
- **Rabbit Hole Progression**: Based on coherence thresholds.
- **Adaptive Wrong Answers**: More plausible as depth increases.

## ‚ú® Future-Proofing Notes

- Region-specific cultural modeling scaffolded
- Era JSON format ready for extension
- Procedural generation of questions possible

# üì£ Instructions for AI

- Maintain modularity
- Expand carefully respecting existing class hierarchy
- Assume culturalCoherence scaffold exists even if initially disabled
- Prefer clean interfaces over type coercion
- Prioritize logical elegance and extensibility
