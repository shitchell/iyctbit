# IfYouCouldTravelBackInTime

A fun quiz game where you see if you could bootstrap technology and change history!

## Setup
- Open `index.html` directly in a modern web browser.
- Ensure `crafting/crafting.json` and `eras/1500AD.json` are in correct relative folders.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` - Core page
- `css/main.css` - Basic styling
- `js/main.js` - Full quiz engine
- `js/data/eras/` - Era definitions and core questions
- `js/data/crafting.json` - Crafting technology graph

## Notes
- Customize `numCoreQuestions` and `exitMidRabbitHole` in `main.js` as desired.
- Add some info bubbles and wiki links in places (not 100% sure where yet)
